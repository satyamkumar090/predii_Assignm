This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to extract structured vehicle specifications such as torque values, part numbers, and component details from an automotive Service Manual PDF.

The goal was to build a text-based RAG pipeline capable of:

  1) Extracting text from a large PDF

  2) Chunking & embedding content

  3) Performing vector retrieval

  4) Using an LLM to answer specification queries

  5) Returning clean structured JSON output

  6)This README explains the system design, tools used, and ideas for improvement.
