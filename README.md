This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to extract structured vehicle specifications such as torque values, part numbers, and component details from an automotive Service Manual PDF.

The goal was to build a text-based RAG pipeline capable of:

Extracting text from a large PDF

Chunking & embedding content

Performing vector retrieval

Using an LLM to answer specification queries

Returning clean structured JSON output

This README explains the system design, tools used, and ideas for improvement.
